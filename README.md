**An app for people who like books.**

BookPal is a reading companion built on the Google Books API.  
You can search for books, add them to your reading list, track bookmarks, and write notes as you read.

Over time, BookPal helps you keep track of what you've read, how it made you feel, and whether you liked it or not.

Use the app in whatever way works for you — and feel free to reach out with thoughts or feedback.  
Enjoy 📚
